The IMAGEJ plugin CONTOUR_ANALYSIS is made to segment discrete shapes and is supposed to be used on images with only two grayscale levels representing closed shapes, like shown in the directory "img_tests".

-Contour_Analysis.java computes and draws the segmentation of the shape (in red) and the normals (in green). It also prints a log of the digital segments and tangents' direction.

To download IMAGEJ : https://github.com/imagej .
To execute this plugin, put all the files into the directory /home/.imagej/plugins, open an image in the software IMAGEJ, then click "plugins" -> "compile and run", search and select Contour_Analysis.java.
